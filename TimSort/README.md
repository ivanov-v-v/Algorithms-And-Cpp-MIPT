# TimSortDIHT

Implementation of modern hybrid sorting algorithm, derived from merge and insertion sort to use advantages of both.
Used as an official one in Java, Python and GNU Octave.

## Feautures:
  1. Adaptive (takes advantage of partial orderings that already exist in most real-world data)
  2. Stable
  3. Guaranteed Theta(N log N) 
  4. O(1) memory overhead (optionable)
